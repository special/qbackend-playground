// qmlscene combines qbackend with one-line execution of QML applications.
//
// qmlscene combines https://github.com/special/qgoscene with qbackend, for a convenient
// way to build and run qbackend applications. qgoscene is a very simple API to run QML
// in a Go process. qgoscene links to Qt directly.
//
// In simple cases, an application can execute with:
//
//     qmlscene.Connection().RootObject = &Root{...}
//     qmlscene.ExecScene("main.qml")
